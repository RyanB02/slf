		    Saddleworth Literary Festival is an annual event taking place in the picturesque village of Uppermill, on the edges of Saddleworth Moor, not many miles from Bronte country.
			<br><br>
			The literary festival prides itself on being a community event involving schools, businesses, local organisations and local councillors. It is a credit to those involved that on a very tight budget the festival manages to attract writers, poets and literary agents from all over the country, as well as highlighting the enormous wealth of talent that exists within Saddleworth, and encouraging young talent from surrounding schools with a writing competition, giving the youngsters the chance to rub shoulders with established writers. 
			<br><br>
			Although in its infancy, the festival organisers have ambitions to make the festival one of the highlights of the Saddleworth events calendar.
